Today's Story: 
```
Today I started with the Striver's SDE Sheet.  I have done 6 questions today. I have done these questions before so I was able to do them easily. I will try to do more questions tomorrow.

It was birthday of one of my friend, so we had pizza party. I ate a lot of pizza. So I am feeling sleepy now. I will sleep now. Good Night.
